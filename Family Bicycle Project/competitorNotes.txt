Pedego Triangle 

1) Electric Bikes, Pedego brand.
2) Pedego offers their own bikes for sale, and they have a lower
price point for entry level electric bikes. They also offer
maintenance, repair, warranties, and eBike rentals. 
3) They appear to only have sixteen bikes that they sell, because they only sell
their own brand exclusively. Likewise, they probably cant repair or offer other 
kinds of maintenance services to other eBikes if a customer were to ask for such a service.
